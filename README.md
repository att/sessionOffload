# Introduction 

This repository has definitions of API's to accellerate network applications by offloading packet processing to a hardware switch. 

The first API was for applications like virtual Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems called OpenOffload.

The second API is for applications like VPN Gateways that intend to offload to IPSEC and GENEVE tunnel processing to the hardware.
